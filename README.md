This project was for the TU/e model reduction (5LMA0) course. 

In this repository you can find the project description, project exercise (questions to answer),
the handed in report (answers to questions) and the Matlab files used to answer these questions.

The Matlab files folder contains the following Matlab scripts:
1D Model: one dimensional model (run Model_1D.m)
2D Model: two dimensional model used for the simulations of exercise 5 to 9 (run Model_2D.m)
Orthogonality: used for exercise 3 and 10

These matlab files are created in 2018b.
